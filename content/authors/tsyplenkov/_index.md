 I'm currently working at the Makkaveev Lab of Soil Erosion and Fluvial Processes, Lomonosov Moscow State University. I'm doing research in soil erosion and sediment transport using in-situ measurements as well as modelling. Projects range from small mountainous rivers to large scale catchments. R enthusiast.
