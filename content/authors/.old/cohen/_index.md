Sagy Cohen earned his Ph.D. in Environmental Sciences at the University of Newcastle, Australia. He held a two-years post-doctoral appointment at the Community Surface Dynamics Modeling System (CSDMS) group within the Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research (INSTAAR) at the University of Colorado. He joined the faculty of the Department of Geography at the University of Alabama in 2012, establishing the Surface Dynamics Modeling Lab (SDML) shortly after. In 2017 he was promoted to Associate Professor.

Dr. Cohenâ€™s primary scientific interest is modeling and analysis of hydro-geomorphic processes and dynamics in large global rivers. He is also leading research and development efforts focusing on flood remote sensing, analysis and modeling.
