Adie's research interests broadly encompass the sustainability of agriculture. They specifically include a number of themes: 1) characterising pollutant emissions to water and air; 2) the development and application of pollutant source tracing procedures; 3) understanding cross-sector water pollution at different scales and the development of screening tools for contextualising the role of agriculture in water quality problems; 4) the impacts of agricultural pollution on aquatic ecology; 5) measuring and modelling the efficacy of on-farm interventions for managing agricultural sustainability; and 6) scenario-based evaluation of technically feasible mitigation impacts for policy support. His expertise includes hydro-chemical monitoring at multiple scales, integrating empirical and modelling approaches for scaling up, and pollutant source fingerprinting. Since 2009, Adie has been a national PI of the Demonstration Test Catchment (DTC) programme. He is also assistant director of the landscape scale Sustainable Intensification Platform (SIP). His UK research council projects include DIVERSe, a BBSRC programme for testing the impact of different vegetation treatments in riparian buffers on hydrology and water quality; an NERC project developing real-time pesticide risk assessment tools; and the BBSRC-funded Institute Strategic Programme Grant (ISPG) at Rothamsted Research, Soil to Nutrition, in which Adie leads work on optimising sustainable intensification of agriculture.
