Dr. Lizaga is a researcher at Ghent University in Belgium, and his primary research focuses on assessing human-induced land and soil degradation. His scientific contributions are helping to enhance the understanding of soil erosion and fine sediment transport, which are among the key global environmental problems threatening agriculture sustainability. His main focus is on soil science and geomorphology, including soil erosion and sediment source fingerprinting modelling, land degradation, remote sensing, water management and geological risks. Dr. Lizaga has published in numerous journals and is presently working in Belgium and collaborating on several international projects alongside researchers from Spain, France, United Kingdom, China, USA, Italy, DR Congo, Per√∫, Serbia, Bolivia, Chile, Iran and Zambia where his is currently supervising a PhD.
